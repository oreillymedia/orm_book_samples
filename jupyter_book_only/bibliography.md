# Bibliography

Bibliography content starts here:

```{bibliography}
:style: alpha
```

```{important}
This format assumes you're using the [Jupyter Book/Bibtex](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html)
citation format; please keep the "style" `alpha`, as that best aligns with our target citation format when using 
this style of bibliography, Chicago Author-Date. If you have questions about citation formats, whether by footnotes
or Author-Date, please contact your editor.
