  <!-- This is a sample book.xml file. See the O'Reilly DocBook Authoring Guidelines at https://prod.oreilly.com/external/tools/docbook/docs/authoring/ for information on working with DocBook XML. -->

  <!-- Reference new files using XIncludes (not entities): http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/ModularDoc.html#UsingXinclude -->

  <!-- Each file should have a DOCTYPE at the top of it so you can validate it alone (just like this but with a chapter/preface instead of book-->

  <!-- Remember, using XIncludes means that you'll have to add a flag (typically 'xinclude' with one or two dashes) when using XML processors/parsers -->

  <!-- Validate with xmllint as follows (Basic setup same as libxslt: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html)-->

  <!-- (please collapse dashes in the line beloew) -->

  <!-- $ xmllint - -xinclude - -noout - -postvalid book.xml -->
